# COMP2101 - Administrative Shell Scripting - Scripting Overview


## Introduction
Topics in this module include scripting concepts and why we do scripting. Also described and implemented is a minimal development environment for use in this course.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this module, students can:
   * describe benefits of automation using shell scripts
   * recognize opportunities for automating shell commands in Linux
   * articulate financial motivations for shell scripting in the business environment

These objectives provide a framework within which to begin learning about shell scripting.

## To do List
   * Participate in the class
   * Read through the presentation
   * Perform the learning activities as described below
   * Do the quiz for this topic

## Lesson Material
   * [Introduction To Shell Scripting Presentation in PDF format](Presentations/COMP2101-00-ScriptingOverview.pdf)
   * Links from the presentation
      * [Github](https://github.com)
      * [Github ebook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## Learning Activity

### Scripting Overview lecture
Pariticpate in the class and review the presentation pdf.

### Lab Environment Preparation
Follow the instructions in the first lab assignment [Linux System Setup for bash Scripting](Labs/bash/BashScriptingSetup.html). The lab will guide you through making sure you have a suitable scripting environment to use for creating and testing bash scripts for this course. When you have completed those instructions, you are ready to submit your first lab on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) under Assignments. The lab instructions tell you what to submit to Blackboard to demonstrate you have completed the lab successfully.

## Quiz
Do the Bash Commands quiz found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests to ensure you are familiar with the bash command line before you begin scripting. It will test your knowledge based on the Linux System Administration course and the Linux Network Administration course which are both pre-requisites for this course. Do it as many times as necessary to earn 70% on it. You will not be able to proceed in this course until you earn at least 70% on the Bash Commands quiz. The Bash Commands Quiz does not count towards your semester mark, but it is required to ensure you are ready to start doing scripting.

Once you have done the Bash Commands Quiz, do the Scripting Overview quiz also found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests. The Scripting Overview quiz counts as part of your semester mark.

## Summary
In this module, we were introduced to scripting terminology and tasks.
Students now can:
   * describe benefits of automation using shell scripts
   * recognize opportunities for automating shell commands in Linux
   * articulate financial motivations for shell scripting in the business environment
Students have:
   * Set up a lab system suitable for creating and testing bash shell scripts
   * created and cloned a personal github repository onto their lab system

Completing the quiz will provide students with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to a bash shell on a Linux system where you have root access.
