## Introduction
In this lesson, we cover the concepts and practice of creating and running shell scripts using the bash shell in a Linux environment. We also introduce bash script testing and debugging.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will:
  * Become familiar with creating and running bash scripts
  * Learn to use github as a collaboration tool for scripting 

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 1 and 6 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the presentation
   * Perform the lab activities as described below
   * Do the quiz for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Bash Scripting Introduction Presentation](Presentations/COMP2101-01-BashScriptingIntro.pdf)
  * Resource links in the presentation
     * [UNIX Command Design Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)

## Learning Activity
Participate in the class and review the presentation. Briefly review any materials available online mentioned in the presentation.

Do the [Bash Scripting Introduction Lab](Labs/bash/COMP2101-bash-lab1.html).

## Graded Activity
Most of the lab is designed to give you hands-on experience and allow you to research and practice the details of the tasks in the lab. Only specific tasks in the lab are graded and the lab instructions tell you what parts of the lab activity are graded. In order to be graded, your work must be pushed to your github repository, and after you click submit on the lab assignment item on blackboard with the URL for your github repository in the comments, you must show your work to the professor to receive your marks.

## Quiz
When you have participated in the class and completed the lab, you will be prepared to write the quiz. The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments & Tests. The quizzes provide your testing mark for this semester.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to creating usable scripts using bash. The tasks you should now be capable of include:
  * Creating appropriate places to keep bash scripts
  * Creating, testing, and modifying bash scripts
  * Deploying bash scripts including user environment customization and filesystem permissions management

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to Ubuntu and your github repository.
