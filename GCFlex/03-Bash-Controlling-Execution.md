# COMP2101 - Administrative Shell Scripting - Controlling Execution

## Introduction
In this lesson, we cover working with jobs and processes in the bash shell, and introduce decision-making into our scripts using **test**, **if**, and **while**.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will know how to:
  * use testing in scripts to test files and data 
  * make execution of commands conditional on the results of testing

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 2, 5, and 6 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the presentation
   * Perform the lab activities as described below
   * Do the quiz for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Conditional Execution In Bash Presentation](Presentations/COMP2101-03-BashExecutionControl.pdf)

## Learning Activity
Participate in the class and review the presentation. Briefly review any materials available online mentioned in the presentation.

Do the [Controlling Execution In Bash Lab](Labs/bash/COMP2101-bash-lab3.html).

## Graded Activity
Most of the lab is designed to give you hands-on experience and allow you to research and practice the details of the tasks in the lab. Only specific tasks in the lab are graded and the lab instructions tell you what parts of the lab activity are graded. In order to be graded, your work must be pushed to your github repository, and after you click submit on the lab assignment item on blackboard with the URL for your github repository in the comments, you must show your work to the professor to receive your marks.

## Quiz
When you have participated in the class and completed the lab, you will be prepared to write the quiz. The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments & Tests. The quizzes provide your testing mark for this semester.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to creating usable scripts using bash. The tasks you should now be capable of include:
  * Using command, data, and file testing to make run-time decisions automatically about which commands to run or not run

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to Ubuntu and your github repository.
