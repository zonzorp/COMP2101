# COMP2101 - Administrative Shell Scripting - Unpredictable Data

## Introduction
In this lesson, we cover looping with **for** and **case**, and using arrays to work with unpredictable data volumes.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will know how to:
  * use **while** and **for** loops
  * use the **case** command
  * implement command line arguments for their scripts
  * work with unpredictable volumes of data using arrays

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 2, 5, and 6 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the presentation
   * Perform the lab activities as described below
   * Do the quiz for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Working With Unpredictable Data In Bash Presentation](Presentations/COMP2101-04-BashLoopsAndArrays.pdf)

## Learning Activity
Participate in the class and review the presentation. Briefly review any materials available online mentioned in the presentation.

Do the [Working With UnpredictableData In Bash Lab](Labs/bash/COMP2101-bash-lab4.html).

## Graded Activity
Most of the lab is designed to give you hands-on experience and allow you to research and practice the details of the tasks in the lab. Only specific tasks in the lab are graded and the lab instructions tell you what parts of the lab activity are graded. In order to be graded, your work must be pushed to your github repository, and after you click submit on the lab assignment item on blackboard with the URL for your github repository in the comments, you must show your work to the professor to receive your marks.

## Quiz
When you have participated in the class and completed the lab, you will be prepared to write the quiz. The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments & Tests. The quizzes provide your testing mark for this semester.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to creating usable scripts using bash. The tasks students should now be capable of include:
  * Writing scripts that can work with unpredictable quantities of data
  * Use the while, case, and for commands to build sophisticated command lists for dynamic data
  * Using command line arguments in their scripts

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to Ubuntu and your github repository.
