# COMP2101 - Administrative Shell Scripting - Miscellaneous Topics in Bash

## Introduction
In this lesson, we introduce using functions, error handling, signals, jobs, data typing, and user dialog beautification.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will know how to:
  * incorporate error handling to make more resilient scripts
  * use functions to create reusable script blocks
  * debug scripts more effectively
  * improve the user experience for users using a script interactively

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 2, 5, and 6 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the presentation
   * Perform the lab activities as described below
   * Do the quiz for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Advanced Topics Presentation](Presentations/COMP2101-05-BashMiscTopics.pdf)

## Learning Activity
Participate in the class and review the presentation. Briefly review any materials available online mentioned in the presentation.

Do the [Advanced Topics Lab](Labs/bash/COMP2101-bash-lab5.html).

## Graded Activity
Most of the lab is designed to give you hands-on experience and allow you to research and practice the details of the tasks in the lab. Only specific tasks in the lab are graded and the lab instructions tell you what parts of the lab activity are graded. In order to be graded, your work must be pushed to your github repository, and after you click submit on the lab assignment item on blackboard with the URL for your github repository in the comments, you must show your work to the professor to receive your marks.

## Quiz
When you have participated in the class and completed the lab, you will be prepared to write the quiz. The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments & Tests. The quizzes provide your testing mark for this semester.

## Summary
In this module, several advanced topics have been introduced. The tasks students should now be capable of include:
  * Producing scripts which are resilient to errors and unexpected faults
  * Creating reusable libraries of script components
  * Effectively debugging scripts
  * Making scripts easier to operate for interactive users

Completing the quiz will provide students with a measure of their knowledge in these areas. For the next class students should have their computing environment available with access to Windows 10 and their github repository.
