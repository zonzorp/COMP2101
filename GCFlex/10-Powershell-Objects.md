# COMP2101 - Administrative Shell Scripting - Working With Objects In Powershell

## Introduction
In this lesson, we learn about creating and manipulating objects in Powershell. We also examine how to use the command line to run commands, create aliases and functions, format or discard output, and look at how pipelines can be used in Powershell. We introduce methods of exploring objects to determine the data and functionality they provide. We explain dot notation and how to create and use custom objects.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will:
  * Understand the purpose and use of objects
  * Be able to examine objects, aliases, and functions to determine their content and uses
  * Know how to format or discard output from Powershell commands
  * Be able to use pipelines to pass objects from one command to another

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 2, 5, and 6 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the presentation
   * Perform the lab activities as described below
   * Do the quiz for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Powershell Objects Presentation](Presentations/COMP2101-02-PSObjects.pdf)

## Learning Activity
Participate in the class and review the presentation. Briefly review any materials available online mentioned in the presentation.

Do the [Powershell Objects Lab](Labs/powershell/02-Powershell-Objects.html).

## Graded Activity
The lab is designed to give you hands-on experience and allow you to research and practice the details of the tasks in the lab. This lab is not graded but you will find the next lab very difficult to accomplish and the quiz difficult to succeed on if you do not do the lab activities first.

## Quiz
When you have participated in the class and completed the lab, you will be prepared to write the quiz. The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments & Tests. The quizzes provide your testing mark for this semester.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to working with objects in Powershell. The tasks you should now be capable of include:
  * Creating objects using command line syntax as well as commands
  * Displaying the structure and data content of objects
  * Creating, using, and displaying the content of aliases and functions
  * Using pipelines to pass objects from one command to another
  * Using the out cmdlets and output redirection to manage command output
  * Using format-table and format-list to modify the display of objects
  * Using dot notation to access the data and methods contained in objects

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to Windows 10.
