# COMP2101 - Administrative Shell Scripting - Doing More With Powershell

## Introduction
In this lesson, we add decision making to our scripts. We also add the ability to use loops to repetitively perform tasks. WMI and CIM are introduced to allow access to system management objects. Remote execution is introduced.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
  * use the **if** and **switch** commands to test objects and combine tests to implement complex decision making in scripts
  * use the **while**, **for** and **foreach** commands to implement loops in scripts
  * run remote commands using the **-computername** parameter
  * explore, retrieve, and manipulate wmi and cim objects

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the presentation
   * Perform the lab activities as described below
   * Do the quiz for this topic

## Lesson Material
  * [Powershell More Presentation](Presentations/COMP2101-04-PSLoopsAndWMI.pdf)

## Learning Activity
Participate in the class and review the presentation. Briefly review any materials available online mentioned in the presentation.

Do the [Powershell More Lab](Labs/powershell/04-Powershell-More.html).

## Graded Activity
Most of the lab is designed to give you hands-on experience and allow you to research and practice the details of the tasks in the lab. Only specific tasks in the lab are graded and the lab instructions tell you what parts of the lab activity are graded. In order to be graded, your work must be pushed to your github repository, and after you click submit on the lab assignment item on blackboard with the URL for your github repository in the comments, you must show your work to the professor to receive your marks.

## Quiz
When you have participated in the class and completed the lab, you will be prepared to write the quiz. The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments & Tests. The quizzes provide your testing mark for this semester.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to working with objects in Powershell. The tasks you should now be capable of include:
  * using the **if** and **switch** commands to test objects and combine tests to implement complex decision making in scripts
  * using the **while**, **for** and **foreach** commands to implement loops in scripts
  * running remote commands using the **-computername** parameter
  * exploring, retrieving, and manipulating wmi and cim objects

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to Windows 10.
