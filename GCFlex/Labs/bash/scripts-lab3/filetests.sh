# This script demonstrates file testing

# Test for the existence of the /etc/resolv.conf file
# TASK 1: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a regular file
# TASK 2: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a symbolic link
# TASK 3: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a directory
# TASK 4: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is readable
# TASK 5: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is writable
# TASK 6: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is executable

# Tests if /tmp is a directory
# TASK 4: Add a test to see if the /tmp directory is readable
# TASK 5: Add a test to see if the /tmp directory is writable
# TASK 6: Add a test to see if the /tmp directory can be accessed
[ -d /tmp ] && echo "/tmp is a directory" || echo "/tmp is not a directory"

# Tests if one file is newer than another
# TASK 7: Add testing to print out which file newest, or if they are the same age
