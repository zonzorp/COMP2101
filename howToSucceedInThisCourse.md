## The Challenge
This course introduces shell scripting which is a programming activity. Students in this course may not be very familiar with scripting, or programming in general, and may find this course to be quite challenging. There are a few very simple things you can do to greatly improve your success in learning these new skills and scoring well in this course.

## Before you start the course
Review the [cheat sheet](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php) on the Ryan's Tutorials website, and if you are not able to make basic use of all of the commands on that cheatsheet, review the relevant sections of [Ryan's Linux tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial). It is required that you are comfortable with the commands on this cheatsheet as well as Linux system and network administration commands. There will be a quiz the first day of the course to assess your basic skills with the bash command line.

## Once The Course Begins

### Presentations and Lab Assignments
Most weeks, there is a presentation on the new material to be learned, and a lab assignment to build your skills. The lab assignments are graded and count as part of your course mark. Some of the presentations have supplemental material available in video form. If you cannot make it to class for a presentation, be sure to review the presentation material and any supplemental material. Lab assignments are due the week after they are assigned. Late assignments will only be accepted under extenuating circumstances. Lab assignments are marked in person, you must show me your work, and be prepared to explain how it works.

### Quizzes
Quizzes cover the technical knowledge and skills taught in the previous week. The quizzes are based on the presentation materials and the lab assignment. The quizzes are 5 minutes, and have both true/false and multiple choice questions. To prepare, be sure you have been in class for the presentation, review the presentation materials, and complete the lab assignment. The quizzes will not be available until you have submitted your lab assignment. Be on time for class. All quizzes are closed book.

### Exams
The exams test your conceptual knowledge and contain short answer questions. There are no multiple choice or true/false questions on the exams. You will be asked to describe how something works, or explain a concept. The exams are closed book. The exam for bash will not be available until you complete the quizzes for bash. The exam for powershell will not be available until you complete the quizzes for powershell.

### Assignment Completion
Because these are new skills for many students, it can be a lot of new material to learn. It is important to attend every class, and to keep up with the lab assignments. Do not leave the lab work for a future time, begin the lab assignments as soon as the material is covered. Each week's materials are built on top of the previous week's materials. If you do not get a lab assignment done on time, do not skip doing it or the next week's lab assignment will be much more difficult to complete. You cannot write a quiz for a topic until the lab has been submitted, so if you do not complete and submit your labs, you will also fall behind in the quizzes.
